    abstract = {A novel fast-ion D-alpha (FIDA) diagnostic that is based on charge exchange spectroscopy has been installed at ASDEX Upgrade. The diagnostic uses a newly developed high-photon-throughput spectrometer together with a low-noise EM-CCD camera that allow measurements with 2 ms exposure time. Absolute intensities are obtained by calibrating the system with an integrating sphere and the wavelength dependence is determined to high accuracy using a neon lamp. Additional perturbative contributions to the spectra, such as D2-molecular lines, the Stark broadened edge D-alpha emission, and passive FIDA radiation have been identified and can be subtracted or avoided experimentally. The FIDA radiation from fast deuterium ions after charge exchange reactions can therefore be analyzed continuously without superimposed line emissions at large Doppler shifts. Radial information on the fast ions is obtained from radially distributed lines of sight. The investigation of the fast-ion velocity distribution is possible due to three different viewing geometries. The independent viewing geometries access distinct parts of the fast-ion velocity space and make tomographic reconstructions possible.},

    abstract = {The fast-ion D(alpha) (FIDA) technique is a charge-exchange recombination spectroscopy measurement that exploits the large Doppler shift of Balmer-alpha light from energetic hydrogenic atoms to infer the fast-ion density. Operational experience with the first dedicated FIDA diagnostic on DIII-D is guiding the design of the second-generation instrument. In the first instrument, dynamic changes in background light associated with plasma instabilities usually dominate measurement uncertainties. Accordingly, the design of the new instrument minimizes scattering of cold D(alpha) light while monitoring its level. The first instrument uses a vertical view to avoid bright interference from the injected-neutral beams. The sightline of the new instrument includes a toroidal component but only measures blueshifted fast-ion light that is Doppler shifted away from the redshifted light of the injected neutrals. The new views are more sensitive to fast ions that circulate in the direction of the plasma current and less sensitive to the trapped-ion and countercirculating populations. Details of the design criteria and solutions are presented.},

    abstract = {A new diagnostic, aimed at energy-resolved measurements of the spatial and temporal dynamics of fast ions in NSTX plasmas, is described. It is based on active charge-exchange recombination spectroscopy. The fast-ion signal is inferred from light emitted in the wavelength range of the D(alpha) line by fast ions recombining with an injected neutral beam. Two complementary systems are operational. The first system, based on a spectrometer coupled to a charge coupled device detector, has 16 channels with space, time, and energy resolution of 5 cm, 10 ms, and 10 keV, respectively. The second system monitors the energy-integrated fast-ion signal on time scales of approximately 20 micros at three different radii. Signals are measured by a multianode photomultiplier tube. For both systems, each channel includes two paired views, intercepting and missing the neutral beam for a direct subtraction of the background signal not associated with fast ions. Examples of signals from the 2008 NSTX run are presented.},

Our algorithm needs no predefined parameters, and in order to capture the global features of the curve in an adaptive fashion, we use a sequence of pruned L-curves that correspond to considering the curves at different scales.

Here we present velocity-space weight functions for NES and neutron yield measurements. Weight functions show the sensitivity as well as the accessible regions in velocity space for a given range of the neutron energy spectrum. Combined with a calculated fast-ion distribution function, they determine the part of the distribution function producing detectable neutrons in a given neutron energy range. Furthermore, we construct a forward model based on weight functions capable of rapidly calculating neutron energy spectra. This forward model can be inverted and could thereby be used to directly measure the fast-ion phase-space distribution functions, possibly in combination with other fast-ion diagnostics. The presented methods and results can be applied to neutron energy spectra measured by any kind of neutron spectrometer and to any neutron yield measurement.},

    abstract = {A second fast ion D-alpha (FIDA) installation is planned at NSTX to complement the present perpendicular viewing FIDA diagnostics. Following the present diagnostic scheme, the new diagnostic will consist of two instruments: a spectroscopic diagnostic that measures fast ion spectra and profiles at 16 radial points with 5-10 ms resolution and a system that uses a band pass filter and photomultiplier to measure changes in FIDA light with 50 kHz sampling rate. The new pair of FIDA instruments will view the heating beams tangentially. The viewing geometry minimizes spectral contamination by beam emission or edge sources of background emission. The improved velocity-space resolution will provide detailed information about neutral-beam current drive and about fast ion acceleration and transport by injected radio frequency waves and plasma instabilities.},

@article{Heidbrink2010,
    abstract = {The fast-ion D$\alpha$ (FIDA) diagnostic is an application of charge-exchange recombination spectroscopy. Fast ions that neutralize in an injected neutral beam emit Balmer-$\alpha$ light with a large Doppler shift. The spectral shift is exploited to distinguish the FIDA emission from other bright sources of D$\alpha$ light. Background subtraction is the main technical challenge. A spectroscopic diagnostic typically achieves temporal, energy, and transverse spatial resolution of ∼1 ms, ∼10 keV, and ∼2 cm, respectively. Installations that use narrow-band filters achieve high spatial and temporal resolution at the expense of spectral information. For high temporal resolution, the bandpass-filtered light goes directly to a photomultiplier, allowing detection of ∼50 kHz oscillations in FIDA signal. For two-dimensional spatial profiles, the bandpass-filtered light goes to a charge-coupled device camera; detailed images of fast-ion redistribution at instabilities are obtained. Qualitative and quantitative models relate the measured FIDA signals to the fast-ion distribution function. The first quantitative comparisons between theory and experiment found excellent agreement in beam-heated magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-quiescent plasmas. FIDA diagnostics are now in operation at magnetic-fusion facilities worldwide. They are used to study fast-ion acceleration by ion cyclotron heating, to detect fast-ion transport by MHD modes and microturbulence, and to study fast-ion driven instabilities.},
